**üì¶ Project Title: Mini E-Commerce Store**

**üîç Project Description:**

This project is a simple e-commerce web application that allows users to browse products, add items to a shopping cart, and place orders. There are two types of users: regular users (customers) and admin users. Customers can register, log in, browse products, manage their cart, and view order history. Admin users can manage the product catalog (add, edit, and delete products).

The app is built using **ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap** for the frontend, and **Spring Boot + MySQL** for the backend APIs and database.
